### Canva
I have used [Canva](http://canva.7eqqol.net/mmft) for the past two years and this website makes the design process for your advertising very simple. I’ve created business cards and flyers for my tutoring business, as well as, posters, and one-page designs for school projects. It is very easy to use, and there are templates you can start with that help make your finished product look professional. I definitely recommend looking into Canva if you plan on marketing with business cards and flyers.

### Bullet Journal
Managing school, a business, chores, and more, is not easy. Because of this, I’ve implemented several habits into my daily routine that help balance these areas of my life. One of my habits is keeping a daily to-do list. [I use a bullet journal](https://amzn.to/3dTlmL8) for this task, and this has helped with my organization immensely. And bullet journals don’t only have to be for to-do lists; writing down your thoughts in general is known to relieve stress and anxiety. This is the journal I use, and I hope you will benefit by using it also.
